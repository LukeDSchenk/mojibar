# To Do 📝

## Search issues 🔎

* Figure out why some substrings return expected results and some don't (try iterating over all children and then all values of all child subtries)

## UI issues 📺

* Figure out color emojis in egui (talk to the creator if need be)

#### Better UI ideas
  * Favorites tab, and all emojis tab
  * search could work on only the open tab?? or maybe that's confusing
  * maybe just a frequently used or recent emojis is better
  * just copy slack? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

## WASM issues

## Administrative issues

* Clean up code
* Clean up repo
* Clean up documenatation
